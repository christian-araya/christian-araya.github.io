As an [NCAS](https://www.nasa.gov/stem/murep/projects/ncas.html) Fellow, I spent 8 weeks researching rocket and mission critical systems for our country's first 2030 manned mission to Mars. After submitting my research paper I was invited to JPL to participate in a 4-day Rover competition with other researchers from across the country.

I took on the roles of Software Engineer and tester for my team. I used MindStorms software to program our rover for two seperate missions involving navigation and payload recovery.
